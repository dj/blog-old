I got the urge to code a game recently, so I made a simple clone of [Dino Runner](https://chromedino.com/), the hidden game on the page that Chrome shows you if it’s unable to connect to the internet.

The [repository is here](https://github.com/dj/dinojump), if you want to check out the code or run it by downloading the Love application for your operating system.

## Picking Lua and LÖVE {#pickingluaandlve}

I don’t know much about game development, but I felt like I wanted something high level and portable. I wanted to learn a new language, because most of the "web" languages I'm familiar with (JavaScript, Java, Python, Ruby) aren’t used much in game development (besides sometimes JavaScript, but usually as a compile target).

I was vaguely aware of Lua’s use as a scripting language used in games, and I wondered if it was common to build entire games with it. I liked the idea of a fast, interpreted language. A simple tool for a simple game.

While studying Lua (reading [Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/), watching [conference talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQhlp6rCrY8), making this game) I get the impression that people don’t really Lua as the main language of a game for much beyond the occasional indie or toy game, but a toy is exactly what I wanted to make.

Lua is a small, simple and fast language with a nice syntax. Spending most of my time at work in JavaScript, it's hard not to wonder about an alternate universe where Lua was the scripting language of the web.

[LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) is a very small, minimal game development framework for Lua, exactly the kind of easy to pick up tool I was looking for. I’m not sure I’d stick with it if I wanted to make a more complicated game, (same goes for Lua), but it was exactly what I needed to get started making a game quickly.

## Finishing for the sake of it {#finishingforthesakeofit}

I’m trying to get better at finishing projects that I start and putting them on the internet instead of letting them sit in my dev folder for years until I delete it years later because there’s no way I’m sharing that silly project I never finished from years ago.
